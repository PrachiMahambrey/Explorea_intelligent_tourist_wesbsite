<h1><b><i>Hidden Gems of India</i></b><h1>
<h6>
India is undoubtedly a very interesting country, that’s getting more and more international arrivals every year. In the past ten years, the number of international tourists has increased by a whopping 97%. But, most of them take more or less the same route: Delhi, Mumbai, Goa, Kasol, Rajasthan, Taj Mahal, Varanasi… A few of them may go to Kerala or the Himalayas, and that’s about it. My point here is that there are a lot of hidden gems in India that often get forgotten and they’re just as beautiful and worth visiting. Here are 9 off-the-beaten-track places in India you probably didn’t know existed.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Tadoba, Maharashtra</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
This is one of the surprisingly unexplored places in India, 
taking in consideration the wildlife here. 
The main attraction of Tadoba is the  National Park, 
which is the oldest national park of Maharashtra, 
and of course, the tiger reserve, 
which is one of the best kept and preserved tiger reserves in India. 
A jeep safari costs only around $90 USD 
and the best time to visit is from October to March 
because the rest of the year it’s either too hot or it’s the monsoon season.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
Sitting at 3048 meters above sea level, 
Tawang is one of the most charming towns 
off the beaten track in India. 
It’s home to several amazing monasteries 
and it’s also the birthplace of the Dalai Lama. 
That’s a fact many people don’t know. 
Getting to Tawang can be a bit challenging 
because the nearest airport is 6 hours away. 
The nearest train station is also a bit far 
and the mountain roads are in a pretty bad condition. 
However, Tawang is worth it. 
The best time to visit is between 
the months of March and September. 
The other months of the year are really cold 
and it’s possible that the roads will be covered in snow.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Nubra Valley, Jammu and Kashmir</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
This amazing cold desert geographically 
belongs to the Tibetian Plateau 
but it’s part of India and its state Jammu and Kashmir. 
The most notable attractions are the sand dunes, 
the Bactrian camel only to be found in 
three other places on Earth and 
Turtuk- a village that feels like a slice of heaven. 
The best time to visit Nubra Valley is 
between the months of June and October. 
The rest of the year is too cold and 
the bad mountains road can be quite challenging.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i> Shillong, Meghalaya</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
The capital of Meghalaya, known as 
‘The Scotland of the East’, 
is one of my absolute favorites in Northeast India. 
The blue mountains, lush forests, streaming waterfalls, 
and the wonderful rituals and traditions 
make Shillong a must-visit place, 
that for some reason often gets skipped by travelers. 
And the mist that circulates around the city 
during the monsoon season makes the city 
even more magical.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
The capital of Jammu and Kashmir is an amazing city. 
A lot of its charm comes from its three pearls: 
Dal Lake, Nagin Lake, and Wular Lake. 
Moreover, Srinagar looks like the winter version 
of Venice and it also has probably 
the biggest floating market in the country. 
You can literally find everything there, including hash and weed. 
Srinagar can be visited throughout the year as it has its own airport. 
However, I would suggest visiting in the winter because 
the city looks even better with its winter clothes on.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Varkala, Kerala</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
Varkala in Kerala is the ultimate little paradise 
and a home to one of the 
most underrated beaches in the country. 
The beaches are clear and pristine, 
surrounded by lush hills and forests. 
The main attractions here are  Varkala Beach, 
Papanasam Beach and the breathtaking Kappil Lake. 
It’s also a great paragliding spot. 
The best time to visit Varkala is between September and April.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Nicobar Islands</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
The place in India that has as 
breathtaking beaches as Goa: that’s Nicobar. 
The untouched nature, dense forests and 
dreamy beaches make this place 
the most beautiful island in India. 
And for some reason, the island isn’t 
well known among tourists. 
To add to that, there actually are 
tribal people living on the island, 
but the access to their village 
is forbidden for visitors.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Gangtok, Sikkim</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
Gangtok is built on a hill 
and it’s one of the most mystical 
and breathtaking cities in the country. 
Sikkim used to be a separate country 
and it joined India back in 1975. 
That’s why things are really different here 
and this just adds to India’s already rich diversity. 
A fun fact is that you are forbidden to smoke 
on the street and cigarettes can 
only be found in a few places. 
Buddhism is the main religion here and 
there’s a lot to see in Gangtok and its surrounding.

<h1 id = "f2" ><b><i>Akshai Chin, Jammu and Kashmir</i></b></h1>
<h1 id = "f1">
<br>
<pre>
Number place to go in Jammu and Kashmir is Aksai Chin. 
This paradise sits comfortably at the ceasefire line 
between India and China. 
That’s why it is known as 
‘One of the most dangerous places in the world’. 
However, there are hardly any tourists in Aksai Chin. 
It is just the heavenly lakes, breathtaking mountains, 
and the cold desert. 
The main attraction is  Pangong Lake, 
at the Indo-China border at more than 
4,200 meters above sea level. 
To this day, this remains 
one of my favorite places in the world.
